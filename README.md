# dotfiles - Personal Development Environment

Configuration files and setup scripts for my development
environment. Everything is managed with simple copy scripts —
no symlinks, no stow, no risk of losing configs.

Your terminal is your workshop. Keep it sharp.

## Features

- **One-command setup** — Clone the repo and run `install.sh`
  to bootstrap a new machine with all dotfiles and packages.
- **Simple sync** — Run `sync.sh` to capture your latest
  system dotfiles into the repo for version control.
- **Automatic backups** — Existing dotfiles are backed up
  before being overwritten during installation.
- **Brewfile** — Every Homebrew package, cask, Mac App Store
  app, and VS Code extension tracked in a single file.
- **Secrets management** — API keys and tokens stay in
  `~/.secrets`, which is never committed to git.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathanialhenniges/dotfiles.git \
  ~/Developer/nathanialhenniges/dotfiles
```

2. Run the install script:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/nathanialhenniges/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

3. Restart your terminal to apply changes.

## Usage

Sync your current system dotfiles into the repo:

```bash
./sync.sh
```

Review the changes, then commit and push:

```bash
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "Update dotfiles"
git push
```

Install dotfiles onto a new machine:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Add a new dotfile by editing the `files` array in `sync.sh`,
then running `./sync.sh` to pull it in. For nested paths under
`~/.config/`, add a `cp` command in the nested config section
of the script.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel) or Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
- Git
- Homebrew (installed automatically by `install.sh` on macOS)

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathanialhenniges/dotfiles.git \
  ~/Developer/nathanialhenniges/dotfiles
```

2. Run the installer:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/nathanialhenniges/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

### Development Scripts

- `./sync.sh` — Pull dotfiles from your system into the repo
  and regenerate the Brewfile.
- `./install.sh` — Install Homebrew, restore packages from
  the Brewfile, and copy dotfiles into your home directory.

## GitHub Codespaces

This repo works automatically with
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
When you create a Codespace, GitHub clones your `dotfiles` repo
and runs `install.sh`. The script detects Linux and installs
lightweight essentials (`zsh`, `git`, `curl`, `wget`, `fzf`)
via `apt` instead of Homebrew. macOS-specific shell config
(Homebrew paths, Android SDK, Oh My Posh, etc.) is skipped on
Linux so your shell loads cleanly.

To enable this, go to **Settings > Codespaces** on GitHub and
set your dotfiles repository to `nathanialhenniges/dotfiles`.
